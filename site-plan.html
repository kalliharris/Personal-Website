      <h2>
        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
       <ul>
        <li>
          The top of the header will contain a link to "home" to allow the audience to view the entire page from the beginning. It will be up with the other two links to my two child pages on my website.
        </li> 
        <li>
          Also in the header, next to the "home" page link, will be a "Designs" link. The "designs" link will take viewers to a full page of most just images. These images will be of my previous nail sets that I have created and completed. This will be an opportunity for customers to have an idea of a possible nail design they may want for themselves. I will put them in rows of 2 or 3 images at a time, and it will be a page they can scroll down through and look at all the images. Possibly in the future, I will divide the images even more into sections like 'holiday','summer', 'fall', etc.
        </li>
        <li>
          Next to both the "home" page link and the "designs" page link, there will be an "order" page link. The "order" link will be linked to another page that will allow viewers to place an order for their own custom set of nails. This page will have a way to create new clients into a system and collect their information such as: name, address, email, phone number, etc. to be able to send them their own set of nails to their doorstep.
        </li>
       </ul>

      <h3>[Page 2]</h3>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            This part of the website will have more images of previous work done. I will possibly put a 'then and now' type of section. This then and now section could include some of the work I did while I was attending Austin Kade Academy in Idaho Falls for nail school. Then next to these images I could put more images compared to the work I do now while working at a nail salon in Rexburg called 'Nailed It'.
          </li>
          <li>
            This section will showcase some of my best works of nail art and give the customer a sense of my abilities and skill set. That way they will know what kind of work I am able to do and the level of difficulty of my nail designs.
          </li>
          <li>
            I will show multiple options and the diversity in my designs as a nail technician. That way, on the "order" page, they can either choose a design from my website that I have done previously, or they can choose their own image from some kind of design online suhc as on Pinterest or Instagram and upload it to their order.
          </li>
        </ul>

      <h3>[Page 3]</h3>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            I will make a possible "About Me" section of the website here in later development. Although in the beginning I may just have this on the home page, I might create a separate page in the future with a link to an "About Me" page. That way people can get to know more about me if they want to.
          </li>
          <li>
            This part will describe a little bit more about me so that my customers can get to know me and know who is the person behind their designs. I will add some pictures of myself and some images of me doing things other than nails.
          </li>
          <li>
            I may include some hobbies and things that I like to show the viewer that I can be relatable and not just a robot selling this item. These photos will be small and I probbaly won't choose more than about 5 or 6 images of me doing things outside of the salon.
          </li>
        </ul>
